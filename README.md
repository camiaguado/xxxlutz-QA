## DOCUMENT 2

1. One of the things that attracted my attention is that it is an International company with offices in Barcelona, which is where I would like to live.
On the other hand, I have worked for many years in an ecommerce company and I think I have a lot of knowledge to contribute.



2. First of all I would ask to my team if they need any help. In case there is nothing to do I would use the time to learn new things or improve what we already have.
I think there are different ways to handle that. I could work overtime if necessary or find some way to negotiate with the PO to extend the deadline
I would talk to my superior to discuss my situation and see if we can find any way to change that.


3. I think that one of the most important parts of building a good environment is related to creating a workplace that is respectful. Caring about each others... it creates trust and teamwork. And being positive, focusing on what's going well instead on focus on problems.



4. I am a proactive and positive person. I usually learn fast and I like to learn new things.
I believe that leading is to encourage others to be better, learn from mistakes and our coworkers and always be willing to contribute to our teams. I like to teach and learn from others constantly.
I like to work in a team and organize my tasks with the team.
I think the short-term goals show progress in less time, which I think is good
I would never accept disrespect
I think that my desire to progress and grow in what I do is always a good contribution
